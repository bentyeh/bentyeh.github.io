excerpt: The activation domains of transcription factors are poorly annotated, and the biochemical mechanisms by which they recruit co-activators such as Mediator remain poorly understood. We developed high-throughput assays to screen libraries of peptide fragments for transcriptional activation activity and co-activator binding. We identified all activation domains (ADs) in yeast transcription factors and trained an accurate deep learning model to predict ADs in human and other yeast proteins. Our results reveal new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription.
