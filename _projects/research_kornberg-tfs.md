title: Modeling Transcription Factor-Coactivator Interactions
setting: Stanford University School of Medicine, October 2018 - present
mentors: <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/roger-kornberg">Dr. Roger Kornberg</a>, <a href="http://www.adriansanborn.com/">Adrian Sanborn</a>
excerpt: The activation domains of transcription factors are poorly annotated, and the biochemical mechanisms by which they recruit co-activators such as Mediator remain poorly understood. We developed high-throughput assays to screen libraries of peptide fragments derived from yeast transcription factors for transcriptional activation activity and co-activator binding. We are currently building predictive machine learning models to predict activity and binding from peptide sequence information and interpreting the models to gain insights into the fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription.
