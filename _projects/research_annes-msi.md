excerpt: |
  [Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry_imaging) is a powerful technique to characterize spatial concentration of metabolites, small molecules, and proteins. We are developing desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-MSI methods towards the following goals:
  1. Track *in vivo* drug distribution to characterize the efficacy of targeted drug delivery strategies.
  2. Characterize metabolic profile of pancreas and adrenal sections from different conditions (diabetes, age, etc.). These metabolic profiles will help us identify biochemical pathways involved in disease progression.
