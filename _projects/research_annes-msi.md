  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry_imaging">Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)</a> is a powerful technique to characterize spatial concentration of metabolites, small molecules, and proteins. We are developing desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-MSI methods towards the following goals:<br>
  1. Track <i>in vivo</i> drug distribution to characterize the efficacy of targeted drug delivery strategies.<br>
  2. Characterize metabolic profile of pancreas and adrenal sections from different conditions (diabetes, age, etc.). These metabolic profiles will help us identify biochemical pathways involved in disease progression.
