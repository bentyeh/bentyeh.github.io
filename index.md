Hi! I am a MD/PhD student in the [UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program](https://mstp.healthsciences.ucla.edu/). Prior to becoming a Bruin, I studied [bioengineering](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu) and [computer science](https://cs.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, where I was fortunate to be advised by fantastic research mentors [Dr. Roger Kornberg](https://med.stanford.edu/kornberg.html) and [Dr. Justin Annes](https://med.stanford.edu/annes-lab.html). I find the iterative cycle of data-driven hypothesis generation, creative experimental design, and modeling an incredibly exciting and compelling approach to science. I love learning new techniques (whether wet lab or computational!) and applying them to explore the mechanisms of disease---and to identify potential therapies.

Outside of lab and coursework, I have enjoyed volunteering at one of [Stanford's free student-run clinics](https://arbor.stanford.edu) as well as a [regional student-run computational biology conference](https://nccb.io/). As an undergraduate, I also had the amazing opportunity to serve as a Peer Health Educator and mentor in a Stanford freshman dorm. In my free time, I love playing piano and volleyball. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if my background aligns with any of your interests!
